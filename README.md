# QuickJS Javascript Engine

## News

* 2019-07-21:
  * New release
  * Updated [benchmark](https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html) with more Javascript engines
* 2019-07-09:
  * First public release

## Introduction

QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the
[ES2019 specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) including modules, asynchronous generators and proxies.

It optionally supports mathematical extensions such as big integers
([BigInt](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-bigint/)), big floating point numbers (BigFloat) and operator overloading.

Main Features:
* Small and easily embeddable: just a few C files, no external dependency, 190
  KiB of x86 code for a simple `hello world` program.
* Fast interpreter with very low startup time: runs the 56000 tests of the
  [ECMAScript Test Suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262) in about 100
  seconds on a single core of a desktop PC. The complete life cycle of a runtime
  instance completes in less than 300 microseconds.
* Almost complete [ES2019](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) support
  including modules, asynchronous generators and full Annex B support (legacy web compatibility).
* Passes 100% of the ECMAScript Test Suite.
* Can compile Javascript sources to executables with no external dependency.
* Garbage collection using reference counting (to reduce memory usage
  and have deterministic behavior) with cycle removal.
* Mathematical extensions: BigInt, BigFloat, operator overloading, bigint mode, math mode.
* Command line interpreter with contextual colorization implemented in Javascript.
* Small built-in standard library with C library wrappers.

## Online Demo

An online demonstration of the QuickJS engine with its mathematical extensions
is available at [numcalc.com](http://numcalc.com). It was compiled from C to WASM/asm.js with Emscripten.

## Sub-projects

QuickJS embeds the following C libraries which can be used in other
projects:
* **libregexp**: small and fast regexp library fully compliant with the Javascript ES 2019 specification.
* **libunicode**: small unicode library supporting case conversion, unicode
  normalization, unicode script queries, unicode general category queries and all unicode binary properties.
* **libbf**: small library implementing arbitrary precision IEEE 754 floating
  point operations and transcendental functions with exact rounding. It is maintained as a [separate project](https://bellard.org/libbf)
